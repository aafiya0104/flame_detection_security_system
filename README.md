# Fire detection security system

> **Abstract** : This project presents the design and implementation of an advanced fire detection security system aimed at ensuring the safety and protection of buildings and infrastructure. The system integrates a variety of detection technologies, including a flame sensor, which are interconnected. By leveraging real-time data processing, the system identifies fire hazards at an early stage, triggering automatic alerts to the occupants.
